# 🖌️ Char_Drawer
Just a fonction to draw 115 symbols on a screen !

## ℹ️ Informations
The only thing you need to know is how to use the commands and there is just a simple fonction named write_string().

So you have only 6 very easy parameters :
- Obviously, you start with the text you want to write on your screen.
- Next you provide the coordinates the X and Y values which will position the text on the screen.
- After that, you can define the color of the character you are going to write with the background's color of your choice.
- Finally, if you want to, you can adjust the size by multiplying it by a number.

That is all you have to know about this very simple program !

And, just in case, you can draw all these symbols : 
- The entire alphabet, in lowercase and uppercase
- The 10 numbers > 0123456789
- These 37 specials caracters > '",:.!?()%_+-*/=[]{}<>;π√~^∞→|°±@#&$\
- These 16 more popular accented letters > àâäéèêëîïôöùûüÿç
- And...the space. Of course !
